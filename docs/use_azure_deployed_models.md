# Use Models Deployed via Azure Service

Agentmake supports both OpenAI and non-OpenAI models, deployed with Azure service.

* specify `azure_any` as backend to use Azure non-OpenAI models

To set up or deploy models with Azure, go to https://ai.azure.com/github.

Go to `Deployment` to check for model names.
